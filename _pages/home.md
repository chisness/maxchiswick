Hello! This is an index page for a selection of my websites, active and inactive and various points in between. The most important ones are starred restaurant menu style.  

# Poker/AI/Math 

*[Poker Camp](https://pokercamp.org): Poker Camp material that combines poker strategy and math, probability, decision making, and other related skills. Under construction. Also cohort learning (virtual and hopefully also IRL) to go through the material. 

*[AI Poker Tutorial](https://aipokertutorial.com): AI Poker technical material, under construction.

*[Poker AI Retreat (PAIR)](https://pokerairetreat.com): A retreat (virtual and hopefully also IRL) to go through the AI Poker material.

*[Expected Value Org](https://expectedvalue.org): Expected value is important and somehow expectedvalue.org was available.  

# Personal Blog

[Chisness.com](https://chisness.com): Operating since at least 2002, some years drastically more active than others. Converting to Substack now. Will be a potpourri of trip reports, weird food optimization, AI stuff, etc. 

# Travel

*[40k.earth](https://40k.earth): Build your own travel map and compare with friends. Goal analogy is LinkedIn : Professional Life :: 40k : Travel Life. [Send feedback!](mailto:max@40k.earth) 

[Carrot Safari](https://carrotsafari.com): Travel index site, but not yet active. 

[Chabad World Tour](https://chabadworldtour.com): I like visiting Chabad houses, especially when traveling. This is a map of the ones I've been to so far. 

[Hotel Eggs](https://hoteleggs.com): I like eating eggs. Unfortunately most hotels do not make very good ones (or maybe I'm staying at the wrong hotels). Site in progress. [Instagram here](https://instagram.com/hoteleggs).

[Rotisserie Ride](https://rotisserieride.com): In late 2019 I came up with an idea to ride a bicycle from LA to NYC via Chicago consuming rotisserie (or other supermarket) chicken each day. I hope that this will happen in 2025 or 2026. Site currently not active. Want to sponsor a chicken or join for a segment? [Get in touch](mailto:max.chiswick@gmail.com).

# Art

[Carrot Museum](https://carrotmuseum.org): Carrots are my favorite food and so I've collected some carrot-related artworks. They will be shown here alongside non-carrot pieces as well.
